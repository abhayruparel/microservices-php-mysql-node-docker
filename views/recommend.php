This way, it increases the firing of neurons and the concentration of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine (4Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source).Research has consistently shown that caffeine can improve various aspects of brain function, including mood, vigilance, reaction time, and memory (6Trusted Source).</p>

It also helps with various health issues, such as cold or nasal congestion. According to a report by the University Health Service (UHS) of the Rochester University, a piping hot cup of lemon tea is scientifically known to have helped people suffering from symptoms of a common cold. But one need not restrict themselves to preparing this beverage hot since it can also be enjoyed ice cold.While the benefits of drinking a glass of warm water with a freshly squeezed lemon and some honey, first thing in the morning is a ritual followed by many people across the globe, a cup of lemon tea also serves the same benefits in equal measures.</p>

These are the most dangerous to drink at high levels because of the toxins known to be present.</p>
